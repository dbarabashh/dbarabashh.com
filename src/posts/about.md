My name is Dima, born in a small city in central Ukraine. I've lived in Kyiv for several years, spent a year in Berlin, and now reside in Warsaw.

With a technical background, I graduated from a technical college and later pursued computer science at university. My interests include economics, business, and psychology, though interest doesn't always imply aptitude.

I really enjoy having fun at techno parties with my friends. I love the vibe of clubs where people feel free and anything is possible. Painted walls, smoke, darkness where you can listen to high-quality music, surrounded by diverse people, each unique in their own way.

I enjoy learning new languages, programming techniques, hiking, and having deep conversations with friends. I'm inspired by people like [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), [Michael B. Paulson](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/ThePrimeagen), [Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey), and [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk/), as they drive my motivation and learning curve.
